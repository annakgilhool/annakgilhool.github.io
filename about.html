	<div class="about_me">
	<p>Welcome! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconisn-Madison. Currently I am a sophomore in the Wisconsin School of Business, majoring in marketing. This website displays my creative endeavors, analytical undertakings, and my life experiences.  Under the <a href="media.html" target="_blank">media</a> page you can find two projects displaying my photography and Adobe Photoshop skills. I hope this website will give you a small insight into my life, but to get to know me a little better, some of my favorite leisure activties include golfing, listening to podcasts, yoga, and skiing. My personal food blog, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/annakatesplate/" target="_blank">@annakatesplate</a>, on Instagram also makes many of my friends call me a "foodie," which I can't deny. This Instagram showcases mostly food around Madison, Wisconsin and Tampa, Florida and a few vacation eats. Thanks for visiting my site and for any inquires please <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact</a> me!</p>
