	<div class="about_me">
	<p>Welcome! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconisn-Madison. Currently I am a sophomore in the Wisconsin School of Business, majoring in marketing. This website displays my creative endeavors in Communication Arts 155: Intro to Digital Media Production.  Under my <a href="media.html" target="_blank">media</a> page you can find two of my most recent project displaying my photography and Adobe Photoshop skills. Besides illustrating my projects, I hope this website will give you a small insight into my life. To get to know me a little better, some of my favorite activties to do in my free time include golfing, listening to podcasts, yoga, relaxing on the beach (or walking on the frozen lakes most of the year), skiing, and stalking fashion bloggers like @songofstyle and @weworewhat. I also have a personal food blog, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/annakatesplate/" target="_blank">@annakatesplate</a>, on Instagram which showcases mostly food around Madison, Wisconsin and Tampa, Florida and a few vacation eats. Thanks for visiting my site and for any inquires please <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact</a> me!</p>
