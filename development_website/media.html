	<p>This TV Poster was an assignment for my CA 115 class. The goal was to design a poster for a show that can convey to networks the genre, format, and storyline of the show. To create this poster I used Photoshop and learned many different tools. My goal for this poster was to create a coming of age show that teens would find relatable. I used icons illustating the themes of family, school, sports, boys, and drugs and alcohol, which tumbled out of the main character's head up to the title of the show, "Gilhool Girl." I wanted the show to be slightly comedic, relayed by the tagline "My head hurts," a reocccurring struggle as a teenager.</p>

	<p>This project involved shooting digital photographs that captured our lab partner. We were experimenting with different focal lengths, such as wide angle and telephoto, and different shot types, such as extreme close up, middle close up, and long shots.	Throughout these images I focused on the principles composition: balance, contrast, focal point, movement, and perspective.</p>
	<p>Throughout these images I incorportated the rule of thirds and tried to keep her sight line on the top third line. I also tried to utilize lookspace. In most of the images there is a lot of negative space so to lead the viewers eye in that direction I had Maura's eye sight and/or body position lead in the direction of the negative space. I also tried to illustrate movement. This can be seen in the image with Maura's scarf floating through the air and her hair flowing in the wind. Contrast is created between her bright yellow hat and the blue sky, bringing the focal point to Maura.</p>
